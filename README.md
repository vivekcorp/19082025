# In the quiet town of Kalipur, nestled between misty hills and mango orchards, lived an old clockmaker named Mr. Das. His shop was a curious little place—walls lined with ticking timepieces, each whispering secrets of the past. But one clock stood apart: a tall, brass grandfather clock with no hands.

# 

# Locals said it was cursed. Mr. Das said it was waiting.

# 

# One monsoon evening, a boy named Arjun wandered into the shop, soaked and shivering. He wasn’t looking for a clock—he was looking for time. His mother was ill, and the doctors had said she had only days left.

# 

# Mr. Das looked at the boy, then at the handless clock. “Time doesn’t always move forward,” he murmured. “Sometimes, it listens.”
